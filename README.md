Me:</b></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Hello!</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">My
name is Gemma Lucas-Laws. I’m 27 years old and I’m in my first
year of studies through Open Universities Australia and RMIT. I am
working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology. I currently
live in Bendigo with my partner, but I lived in Melbourne for almost
ten years. Originally I am from a town in regional Victoria called
Sale. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">My
family have been in Australia for many generations, we have even
traced ancestors on my mother’s side all the way back to the first
fleet. My father’s side of the family has also been in Australia
for generations, originally coming from Scotland. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
describe myself as a “Jack of all trades” as I have many skills
and hobbies. I am a intermediate seamstress and beginner knitter, I
spend a lot of time painting and drawing, as well as having
experience as a musician. My favourite instrument to play is the
mandolin, however I also play guitar and ocarina.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Why
IT?</b></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
think for me, my interest in technology started when I was very
young. I have an older brother who was always into games and tech,
which I suspect was where I was first exposed to IT.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">When
I was a young teenager I learned of a program called FKiSS. Which is
a program used for “Electronic Paper Dolls”. So essentially an
advanced drag and drop dress up game, I played a lot of these FKiSS
sets before finally embarking on a journey to create my own. It was a
difficult process as there were not a lot of resources to learn from.
I largely had to learn the independent coding language from a single
tutorial I found, trial and error, and picking apart code other
members of the community had created. FKiSS was my first foray into
coding, and I enjoyed coding FKiSS sets for a few years before the
online community started to disappear.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
chose RMIT to pursue my education in IT because it has a incredible
reputation within the tech community. I think that even if I weren’t
doing online education I still would have chosen to study at RMIT. In
the past I have had friends study at RMIT and they have all been very
satisfied with their experience. I also understand that RMIT
graduates have considerable job prospects. Something I also
considered was the reputation that RMIT holds in the international
job market In addition to all that, the RMIT Bachelor of Information
Technology was the best option in regards to an online course.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
hope that by completing this degree I will learn a broad range of
skills. I am most intrigued by coding and web development and
although I have limited experience with that kind of work, I very
much enjoy the challenge that comes with creating something from
scratch. I enjoy problem solving activities and I feel that coding
really encompasses that. I would also like to learn more about
networks. I have a few friends who work as network administrators and
I feel that it is a role I would do well in, again because in a role
like that you are constantly being faced with a new challenge that
needs to be solved. I also think I would like to explore software
engineering, however as I don’t have much experience in IT, I think
the best thing to do is to get a bit of a taste for all aspects of IT
before choosing a specialised path.</font></font></p>

<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This
position interests me as it is a high pressure management role. I
feel that the appeal in positions like this is the broad range of
skills necessary to successfully thrive in the role.  I can see from
the advertisement that the employer is looking for a person who can
manage their whole network. The applicant will be in charge of
ensuring that each part of the system is working as required. There
are aspects of customer service, as well as needing a knowledge of
Microsoft software, and file storage.  </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
employer is looking for someone who has experience managing a Wintel
network, which is Windows/Intel, as many users use Wintel devices, it
is safe to assume most experience managing networks could easily be
transferred to this role. I could get experience by working as a
Junior System Administrator.</font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This
indicates that I am shy and reserved, but also hard working.  My mid
range score in the “Consciencious” field above reflects on my
good organisation and self discipline, but also my flexibility when
it comes to how to approach a task. As an INFP I am more creative
than others, which allows me to consider unconventional solutions to
problems. However, as an INFP I am also much more likely to feel
overwhelmed by deadlines and a long list of tasks in which I do not
know where to start.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
think that the impact this has on my ability to work as part of a
team is that while I am willing to consider the opinions of other
team members, I am not likely to voice my own. Especially if I am
part of a larger group. I feel that this is due to anxieties of
wanting to please the other group members, and I will sacrifice my
own desires in order to keep others happy. Although I am not “born
to lead” I am a dedicated worker, once given a task I ensure that
it is completed to the highest standard possible, often spending
hours perfecting small details. </font></font>

<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">As
a Visual Learner, I find it easiest to understand new concepts when I
can observe them, whether that is through a video tutorial or series
of diagrams. I like to colour code things so that I can easily refer
back to a particular subject and I have good spacial awareness. I
quickly learn my way around new environments. I think that this is an
advantageous trait to have as part of a team because I can visualise
in my mind how to solve a puzzle as well as easily sketch out ideas I
have in order to use them as a visual aid for other members of the
group.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>My
Tech Idea:</b></font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
would like to work on a mobile application that will encourage and
guide users to make better choices in regards to the food they are
buying. My app will essentially be a database of what products
contain factory farmed meat, fish, poultry, dairy and eggs. The user
will scan the barcode of the product that they are interested in,
using the camera on their device and the app will search the database
and display information on the animal products used in it. Because
the information stored in the database will be simple numerical data
ideally I would like that data to be stored on the user’s device so
that it can be used offline.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Although
not everyone considers the moral consequences of buying factory
farmed meat, there are many people who wish to make more ethical
decisions in regards to the products that they consume who do not
wish to give up animal products altogether. I believe that an app
such as this can provide users the  knowledge they need to make an
informed decision. My motivation in pushing an app like this is to
bring awareness of factory farmed animal products to people </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
app will work by using the inbuilt camera on the device to take a
photo of the barcode on a product. In the event that the barcode will
not scan, the user can directly input the number beneath the barcode
using the keyboard. In the event that a user scans a product that is
not listed in our database, the barcode is sent to the developers and
we will use this information to see which products need to be added
to our database. To begin with, the app will likely have a small
budget and so I think that on release the app will not be able to
cover every product on the market. I would like the app to provide
information on bigger international brands at first such as Nestle,
Kellog’s and Kraft Foods. So upon first release you might scan the
barcode on a packet of Maggi Chicken Flavoured 2 Minute Noodles and
the app would only be able to provide information on the Maggi brand,
as well as it’s parent company Nestle. Assuming that after some
time the app became more successful and the project budget improved I
would work on adding less widely available brands as well as
information on specific products within a particular brand. I have
also considered the applications of this service outside of packaged
foods. For example it could also be applied to the beauty industry
and could give information on items such as makeup, perfumes and hair
care products. In this use of the app, it could also be configured to
show whether or not those products were tested on animals.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
have inserted a simple table below in order to better clarify how the
app would display this information to the end user.</font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">You
can see in the example table that there would be a simple indicator
showing whether or not that brand uses ethically sourced products,
where a red icon indicates that the brand does not use ethically
sourced products of that type. I think that a streamlined user
interface is the best option as it makes the data quick and easy to
read, it is also not intimidating for older users or people who are
less technologically inclined. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Within
the settings page of the app, there would be an option to choose your
preferred stock density. I think that this is a necessary feature in
an app such as this because there is some controversy over what is
considered ‘free range’ for example, according to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00474">Australian
Consumer Law</a>, eggs sold in Australia are allowed to be marketed
as free range provided that there are no more than 10,000 hens per
hectare. <a href="https://www.rspca.org.au/campaigns/layer-hen-welfare">RSPCA</a>
however disagrees and suggests that no more than 1,500 hens should be
farmed per hectare. The app can also be adjusted within the settings
to show if a product is organic or not.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">One
of the key things to note is that if I wish to publish my app on the
Apple store is that it must be made on an IDE called Xcode, which is
a mac exclusive. This means that I would need a mac to create the
app, as well as needing at least one mobile apple device on which to
test my app. Similarly to create an android version of the app I
would need an android device for testing as well as a coding
environment such as JDK. I will also need a developer account for
both google play and the apple store.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
skills I would have to learn to create my app include learning to
code. From what I understand I would have to learn to code in Swift
in order to create an apple app. Android apps on the other hand can
be coded in many common coding languages. I would probably choose to
code my app in java as I have the most experience working with java.
There are many resources online teaching how to code and I am also
learning programming through Open Universities Australia and RMIT. My
app is a great first project as it does not require any specialised
hardware.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
will consider my project successful as long as it is getting people
to question their choices when it comes to the source of their food.
When it comes to making ethically sound choices many people turn a
blind eye or are simply uninformed. I hope that this app will not
only raise awareness of exactly how many companies use factory farmed
goods in order to cut costs, but also encourage those companies to
make better choices in regards to what they’re putting into their
products and maybe even inspire new businesses who do want to use
ethically sound ingredients.</font></font></p>
